Project README (Website Platform)
Overview

This project is a modular website platform designed to be flexible, scalable, and extensible.
It combines a strong core framework with a library of reusable widgets, admin tools, and permission-based subdomains.

The platform allows:

Widget-based page design (similar to Squarespace/Wix).

Permission-controlled subdomains for custom internal or branded sites.

Admin and user management with fine-grained role and permission assignment.

Customizable layouts where users can resize and position widgets dynamically.
